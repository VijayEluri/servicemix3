Welcome to ServiceMix
=====================

This project makes use of the Maven tool...

http://maven.apache.org/

to build itself. Please download maven 1.x,
install it as per the instructions on Maven's site and then type

  maven

Maven will download ServiceMix dependencies from global repositories.
You may experience failures due to timeouts accessing these repositories.
In such cases, retry until all dependencies have been sucessfully downloaded.

You may run into path name length limitation if you try to build ServiceMix
under Windows using Cygwin.  In these cases, you should move the source 
directory higher in the file system tree.

Enjoy!
